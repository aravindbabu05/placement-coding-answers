# placement-coding-answers

Hi everyone, 
 Here i'll be sharing all the placements coding questions and i follow a systematic naming conventions so that by looking the question/file name you will be able to understand form which company the questin is and if you found any question/file name without a  proper naming convention it's a miscellaneous coding question .
 
 Example of Naming Convention :
 For suppose take the tcs company given to find the minimum value in the array  then the file name will be TCS_MinValveArray .
 
 
 And you can always reachout to me on linkedin and you can find the link in home page of my github.
 
 
 Thank you
